# python-projects-1

I put some of my Python scripts here as finished ideas and experiments

I have some other files around Facebook Graph API, Twitter API and Instagram API which I want to upload sometime. But first I want to make more broadly usasble, so data can be printed on screen, written to CSV or saved to a database. And also with more flexible input.
