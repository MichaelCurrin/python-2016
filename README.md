# Python 2016

Collection of my Python scripts written up to 2016.

These were my first Python scripts on Github. Previously in separate repos and then merged into one (but keeping history, thanks to a git tutorial).

There are little or no library setup instructions here. Scripts are all in **Python 2**.
