Daily traffic report for website data in Google Analytics API

Required points:
		Purpose: look for sudden spikes in session volumes each day.
		Daily mail  to be sent automatically to Media dept.
		Show values for start of month to yesterdayâ€™s date.
		Run on schedule
		Split by brand and then into Channel grouping. 
         All channel names within the brand (segment) are shown 
         without any filtering or renaming.
