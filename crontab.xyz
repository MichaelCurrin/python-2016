# Notes
# Note that each row executes independently, starting from the home directory regardless of where the row about it ended.
# in order to run two independent commands sequentially use a semi-colon to separate
# e.g. cd Documents; ls
# make sure that the 1st command had finished when the 2nd starts, by separating with && as above.

# Also note that omitting the && and executing two commands in one is formally fine in the console
# e.g. $ cd "Google Drive"/Cron/Scheduled_GA_Reporting/python execute_tech_report.py
# unfortunately this leads to problems in cronjob. Particulaly if execute_tech_report.py imports a config file in its working directory
# but crontab still thinks the working directory is username rather than username/"Google Drive"/Cron/Scheduled_GA_Reporting
